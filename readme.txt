This repository contains the python file that powers the search engine for the Volga German dictionary at http://bigcat.fhsu.edu/cgi-bin/volgagerman/dictionary2.py, a part of the Kansas Humanities Council grant project. More on the project can be found at http://bigcat.fhsu.edu/volgagerman/about.html. 

The search engine supports approximate string search and returns examples in context from a linguistic corpus, e.g. http://bigcat.fhsu.edu/cgi-bin/volgagerman/dictionary2.py?yyy=gefingniss. 

The csv file found in the repository provides a dictionary model.
